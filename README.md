# NLP_PRACTICALS
1
Perform tokenization (Whitespace, Punctuation-based, Treebank, Tweet, MWE) using NLTK library. Use porter stemmer and snowball stemmer for stemming. Use any technique for lemmatization.
2
Perform bag-of-words approach (count occurrence, normalized count occurrence), TF-IDF on data. Create embeddings using Word2Vec
3
Perform text cleaning, perform lemmatization (any method), remove stop words (any method), label encoding. Create representations using TF-IDF. Save outputs
4
Create a transformer from scratch using the Pytorch library
5
Morphology is the study of the way words are built up from smaller meaning bearing units. Study and understand the concepts of morphology by the use of add delete table.
6
Use a more advanced model for sentiment analysis
7
Write a better auto-complete algorithm using an N-gram model (similar models are used for translation, determining the author of a text, and speech recognition)
